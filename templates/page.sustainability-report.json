We crafted a brand that delivers at every level of our commitment to quality, ethics, product integrity, design and value. Stripping away the friction and ambiguity in the online diamond buying process by offering you high-quality jewelry choices that ethically sourced and 100% guilt-free, is our main goal. Our commitment to ethical luxury parallels your commitment to ethical shopping at the best possible price...always.<\/p><p>The process of traditionally securing mined diamonds has been known to be very destructive to the environment and comes at a high cost to both the earth as well as, you, the consumer. It is no secret that conflict diamonds still exist today, and their sales contribute to the funding of war, abuse, and oppression. Preventing this pattern of violence is what inspired us to start a brand that is committed to selling only 100% conflict-free, lab grown diamonds.<\/p><p>Lab created diamonds are remarkable in quality but instead of being mined from the ground are grown in highly controlled laboratory environments using advanced technological processes that duplicate the conditions in the earth. Learn more about the processÂ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grownbrilliance.com\/education-guide\/how-lab-created-diamonds-are-made\">here to learn How are lab created diamonds made?<\/a>.<\/p><p>The optical, chemical and visual composition of a lab-created diamond is identical to a mined diamond. Since it is grown in a controlled environment, we can even control the color and clarity to some extent. This helps us offer clearer and near colorless diamonds at prices that are much lower than that of mined diamonds of similar qualities. We believe you deserve value and quality without compromising on ethics or conscious choice.
